# Server Performance Stats

This is a learning project with instructions found at https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats

The task is to write a script to analyse basic server performance stats. The script, server-stats.sh, should be able to run on any Linux server and give the following stats:

Total CPU usage
Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
Top 5 processes by CPU usage
Top 5 processes by memory usage

To use the script, simply clone the repo, ensure the file has executable permissions (chmod +x ./server-stats.sh) and run with ./server-stats.sh.
